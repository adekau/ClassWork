// Using sem_timedwait here because if there's a deadlock (1 process has
// stdin and another has stdout) then those processes that hold those two
// semaphores would infinitely wait on the next sem_wait because both
// semaphores are taken. Sem_timedwait will cancel the wait if it goes past
// whatever is defined in a timespec struct. This will allow the breaking of
// the deadlock later in the code.
